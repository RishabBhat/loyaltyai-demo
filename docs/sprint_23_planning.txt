SPRINT GOAL: Kafka Migration Phase 1 - Eliminate Top of Funnel Script Dependencies

KEY INITIATIVES:
1. Replace Top of Funnel script with real-time Kafka-based eligibility processing
2. Implement automated spouse assignment workflow
3. Fix dual eligibility conflict resolution
4. Database performance improvements for member lookup queries

USER STORIES - TAJ MAHAL TEAM:
- [LY-1847] As a system, I need to process eligibility updates via Kafka instead of batch scripts
- [LY-1848] As a member, I want my spouse to be automatically assigned to my family membership
- [LY-1849] As a developer, I need improved database query performance for member searches
- [LY-1850] As a system, I need to handle dual eligibility scenarios without manual intervention

USER STORIES - MACHU PICCHU TEAM:  
- [LY-1851] As a member, I want my fitness device data to sync reliably without delays
- [LY-1852] As a system, I need to migrate eligibility rules from Top of Funnel to event-driven processing
- [LY-1853] As a support agent, I need better error messages for eligibility failures
- [LY-1854] As a developer, I need monitoring alerts for Kafka consumer lag

TECHNICAL DEBT:
- Remove deprecated Top of Funnel script dependencies
- Update member eligibility documentation
- Refactor spouse assignment logic for better error handling
- Add comprehensive unit tests for dual eligibility scenarios

DEPENDENCIES:
- Platform team: Kafka topic creation and permissions
- DBA team: Database index optimization review
- Security team: New service-to-service authentication tokens

RISKS:
- Top of Funnel script still needed as fallback during transition
- Dual eligibility logic complexity may cause delays
- Kafka consumer performance under high load needs validation

TEAM CAPACITY:
- Taj Mahal: 42 story points planned, 45 point velocity
- Machu Picchu: 38 story points planned, 40 point velocity

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- All code reviewed and approved
- Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests passing in dev and stage
- Performance tests completed
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to stage environment

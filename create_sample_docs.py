Sprint Dates: January 15 - January 29, 2025

SPRINT GOAL: Kafka Migration Phase 1 - Eliminate Top of Funnel Script Dependencies

KEY INITIATIVES:
1. Replace Top of Funnel script with real-time Kafka-based eligibility processing
2. Implement automated spouse assignment workflow
3. Fix dual eligibility conflict resolution
4. Database performance improvements for member lookup queries

USER STORIES - TAJ MAHAL TEAM:
- [LY-1847] As a system, I need to process eligibility updates via Kafka instead of batch scripts
- [LY-1848] As a member, I want my spouse to be automatically assigned to my family membership
- [LY-1849] As a developer, I need improved database query performance for member searches
- [LY-1850] As a system, I need to handle dual eligibility scenarios without manual intervention

USER STORIES - MACHU PICCHU TEAM:  
- [LY-1851] As a member, I want my fitness device data to sync reliably without delays
- [LY-1852] As a system, I need to migrate eligibility rules from Top of Funnel to event-driven processing
- [LY-1853] As a support agent, I need better error messages for eligibility failures
- [LY-1854] As a developer, I need monitoring alerts for Kafka consumer lag

TECHNICAL DEBT:
- Remove deprecated Top of Funnel script dependencies
- Update member eligibility documentation
- Refactor spouse assignment logic for better error handling
- Add comprehensive unit tests for dual eligibility scenarios

DEPENDENCIES:
- Platform team: Kafka topic creation and permissions

RISKS:
- Top of Funnel script still needed as fallback during transition
- Dual eligibility logic complexity may cause delays
- Kafka consumer performance under high load needs validation

TEAM CAPACITY:
- Taj Mahal: 42 story points planned, 45 point velocity
- Machu Picchu: 38 story points planned, 40 point velocity

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- All code reviewed and approved
- Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests passing in dev and stage
- Performance tests completed
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to stage environment''',

        'docs/kafka_migration_edr.md': '''# Engineering Design Record (EDR): Kafka-Based Eligibility Processing

**EDR ID**: LY-EDR-2025-003  
**Author**: Taj Mahal Team  
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: Approved  

## Problem Statement
The current Top of Funnel script runs daily as a batch process to manually configure member eligibility, creating delays in member enrollment and causing data inconsistencies. This approach doesn't scale with our growing member base and prevents real-time eligibility updates.

## Current State Analysis
### Existing Architecture
- **Top of Funnel Script**: Perl script running daily via cron job
- **Eligibility Database**: MySQL tables updated once per day
- **Manual Interventions**: Support team regularly fixes eligibility conflicts
- **Processing Time**: 4-6 hours for full member base processing
- **Failure Recovery**: Manual restart and data reconciliation required

### Pain Points
1. **Delayed Eligibility**: New members wait up to 24 hours for loyalty program access
2. **Dual Eligibility Issues**: Script cannot handle complex eligibility scenarios
3. **Spouse Assignment Failures**: Manual intervention required for 15% of family enrollments
4. **Poor Observability**: Limited logging and monitoring of eligibility processing
5. **Technical Debt**: Legacy Perl codebase with minimal documentation

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Architecture
Replace batch processing with event-driven Kafka-based eligibility management:

```
Member Enrollment Event ‚Üí Kafka Topic ‚Üí Loyalty-Eligibility Service ‚Üí Member Database
                                    ‚Üì
                              Real-time Processing
                                    ‚Üì
                         Eligibility Status Update ‚Üí Kafka Topic ‚Üí Downstream Services
```

### Implementation Design

#### Kafka Topics
1. **member.enrollment.events**: New member registration events
2. **member.eligibility.updates**: Eligibility status changes
3. **member.family.assignments**: Family member relationship events
4. **eligibility.processing.errors**: Failed eligibility processing events

#### Service Changes

**Loyalty-Eligibility Service Updates**:
- Add Kafka consumer for enrollment events
- Implement real-time eligibility rule engine
- Add spouse auto-assignment logic
- Enhanced dual eligibility conflict resolution

**Loyalty-Member Service Updates**:
- Publish member events to Kafka topics
- Update member status based on eligibility events
- Add family relationship management APIs

#### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Add eligibility processing audit table
CREATE TABLE eligibility_processing_log (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    processing_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    eligibility_rules_applied JSON,
    processing_status VARCHAR(20),
    error_details TEXT,
    INDEX idx_member_timestamp (member_id, processing_timestamp)
);

-- Add spouse assignment tracking
ALTER TABLE loyalty_members 
ADD COLUMN spouse_assignment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
ADD COLUMN spouse_assignment_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 23)
- Set up Kafka topics and consumer infrastructure
- Implement basic eligibility event processing
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Success Criteria**: Process 100% of new enrollments via Kafka

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Sprint 24)  
- Implement spouse auto-assignment workflow
- Add dual eligibility conflict resolution
- Performance optimization and load testing
- **Success Criteria**: Reduce spouse assignment failures to <5%

#### Phase 3: Migration Complete (Sprint 25)
- Decommission Top of Funnel script
- Full production cutover to Kafka processing
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- **Success Criteria**: Zero dependency on batch processing

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Kafka Consumer Lag**: Implement consumer scaling and monitoring
- **Database Performance**: Add appropriate indexes and connection pooling
- **Data Consistency**: Use database transactions and event ordering

#### Operational Risks  
- **Processing Failures**: Implement dead letter queues and retry mechanisms
- **Rollback Strategy**: Keep Top of Funnel script as emergency fallback
- **Monitoring**: Add Splunk dashboards for real-time processing metrics

### Success Metrics
- **Eligibility Processing Time**: < 5 minutes for new enrollments
- **Spouse Assignment Success Rate**: > 95% automatic assignment
- **Dual Eligibility Resolution**: < 2% requiring manual intervention
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability for eligibility processing

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all eligibility rule logic
- Integration tests with Kafka test containers
- Performance tests simulating peak enrollment periods
- End-to-end testing in stage environment''',

## Common Incident Scenarios

### Member Eligibility Processing Failures

**Symptoms**:
- New member enrollments not processing
- Members unable to access loyalty platform
- Increased support tickets about eligibility

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check Kafka consumer lag for eligibility topics
```bash
kubectl exec -it kafka-client -n loyalty-prod -- kafka-consumer-groups.sh \\
  --bootstrap-server kafka-prod-cluster.optum.com:9092 \\
  --describe --group loyalty-eligibility-consumer
```

2. Verify database connectivity
```bash
kubectl exec -it loyalty-member-service-pod -n loyalty-prod -- \\
  mysql -h loyalty-prod-mysql.optum.com -u loyalty_user -p -e "SELECT 1"
```

**Resolution Actions**:
- Restart Kafka consumers if lag is excessive
- Check for database connection pool exhaustion
- Verify Kubernetes pod resource limits
- Review recent deployments for configuration changes

### Dual Eligibility Conflicts

**Symptoms**:
- Members showing multiple active eligibilities
- Point calculation errors
- Support tickets about incorrect reward balances

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Identify affected members
```sql
SELECT member_id, COUNT(*) as eligibility_count 
FROM member_eligibilities 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' 
GROUP BY member_id 
HAVING eligibility_count > 1;
```

2. Temporary workaround - disable conflicting eligibility
```sql
UPDATE member_eligibilities 
SET status = 'TEMPORARILY_DISABLED' 
WHERE member_id = 'AFFECTED_MEMBER_ID' 
  AND eligibility_type = 'SECONDARY';
```

3. Engage Taj Mahal team for permanent resolution

### Spouse Assignment Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Family members not linked properly
- New spouses unable to join existing family plans
- Support escalations for family enrollment issues

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check spouse assignment processing logs
```splunk
index=optum_loyalty source="loyalty-member-service" "spouse assignment" error
```

2. Verify family relationship data
```sql
SELECT family_id, member_id, member_role 
FROM loyalty_members 
WHERE family_id = 'AFFECTED_FAMILY_ID';
```

## Common Database Operations

### Member Lookup Queries
```sql
-- Find member by UHC ID
SELECT m.*, fm.relationship_type, fm.primary_member 
FROM loyalty_members m
LEFT JOIN family_members fm ON m.member_id = fm.member_id
WHERE m.uhc_member_id = 'UHC12345001';

-- Check for dual eligibility
SELECT m.member_id, m.uhc_member_id, COUNT(me.eligibility_id) as active_eligibilities
FROM loyalty_members m
JOIN member_eligibilities me ON m.member_id = me.member_id
WHERE me.status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY m.member_id, m.uhc_member_id
HAVING active_eligibilities > 1;
```

### Troubleshooting Queries
```sql
-- Members with spouse assignment issues
SELECT member_id, uhc_member_id, spouse_assignment_status, enrollment_date
FROM loyalty_members 
WHERE spouse_assignment_status = 'FAILED'
AND enrollment_date > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);

-- Recent eligibility processing errors
SELECT member_id, processing_type, processing_status, error_details, processing_timestamp
FROM eligibility_processing_log
WHERE processing_status = 'ERROR'
AND processing_timestamp > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
ORDER BY processing_timestamp DESC;
```

## Database Maintenance

### Daily Health Checks
```sql
-- Check connection pool usage
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT * FROM information_schema.processlist 
WHERE command != 'Sleep' AND time > 30;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
    table_name AS 'Table',
    ROUND(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS 'Size (MB)'
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'loyalty_platform_prod'
ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;
